## Conclusion

Initial reading took me around 10 months of average spending 1 hour per day. I started in october 2019 and finished in july 2020. I did around 80% of homework given in book. Book is paying off, it gives a solid knowledge about basics of C++. I am publishing my solutions to chapter 27, exercises from previous chapters I did in dirty way so I don't want to put them here(some of them was very difficult for newbie). I am planning to do second round with the book to solidify basics and honestly do tasks which I will publicate here later.

## Setup

Most of the book I did using  Windows with newest Visual Studio Community which is pretty good but uncomfortable to using during writing small programs. On last chapter I switched to Linux and Visual Studio Code which made programming of small stuff more comfortable.
