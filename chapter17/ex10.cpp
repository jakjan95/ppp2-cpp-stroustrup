/* 
Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
Chapter 17 Exercise 10:
    Look at your solutions of exercise 7. Is there any way that input could get the array to overflow; that is,
    is there any way you could enter more characters that you allocated space for (seroius error)? 
    Does anything reasonable happen if you try enter more characters than you allocated?

/*
    Actually nothing bad happens when we put lot of character to input :)
